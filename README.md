# book-library

Consists of two pages: Home Page and Front Desk.

On Home Page Please display a list of books, which you can fetch from this API: https://63c10327716562671870f959.mockapi.io/books

On Front Desk page, you need to add a form that will allow us to add a book. This book should be then appended to the list of books displayed on the homepage. New books should be displayed first.


Considerations:
No need to persists books in browser storage.


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
